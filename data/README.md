# Data Folder

This `data` folder should contain your puzzle input data for the Advent of Code challenges. Each file corresponds to the puzzle input for a specific day, formatted as `day-{nn}.txt` where `{nn}` is the two-digit day number. For example, the puzzle input for Day 1 is stored in a file named `day-01.txt`.

## File Naming Convention

- Files are named using the pattern `day-{nn}.txt`, where `{nn}` is the zero-padded day number (e.g., `01`, `02`, ..., `25`).
- Example:
  - Day 1 puzzle input: `day-01.txt`
  - Day 15 puzzle input: `day-15.txt`

## File Contents

- Each file contains the raw puzzle input data for the corresponding day.
- The format and structure of the data depend on the specific Advent of Code puzzle for that day.

## How to Use

1. **Accessing Puzzle Input Data:**
   - Locate the file corresponding to the day of the challenge (e.g., for Day 3, use `day-03.txt`).
   - Open the file to view or read the puzzle input.

2. **Adding New Inputs:**
   - When starting a new day's challenge, save the puzzle input in a file named `day-{nn}.txt` inside this folder.
   - Ensure the naming convention is followed to maintain consistency.

## Best Practices

- **Do Not Share:** Puzzle inputs are unique to each user. Avoid sharing these files publicly.
- **Keep Data Organized:** Store only the puzzle input files in this folder to prevent clutter.
- Ensure that the input files are properly saved as plain text.
- If you encounter issues with file encoding, verify that the files are saved in UTF-8 format.
